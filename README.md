This is a reminder / task webapp that I built during the summer before my senior year of highschool. 

I was unhappy with many reminder application's being organized primarly around an intended date of completion.

With dozens of tasks often "due" on certain day, these applications serve as little more than a list.

This platorm was built around the concept of priority -- what needs to get done now, soon, and "later" ;)

It got me through senior year & my college applications. Maybe it can be of use to you.
